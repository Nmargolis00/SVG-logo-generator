# SVG Logo Generator

## Description

This project helped me to think through how to approach a problem and build it out with JavaScript. I utilized exporting and importing various files to create and test the program. It uses inquirer to display prompts in the terminal and jest to create tests for the program to ensure that it works properly. I needed fs to write the file in SVG.
